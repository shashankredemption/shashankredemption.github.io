        <h1>What‚Äôs Been On My Mind 2019</h1>
        <p style="margin-left:-15px">Just gonna try to catalogue some of the things I've thought about in various
            categories, but also things I did? Pretty disjointed, but alas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Working is kinda awful and I feel mostly deceived in the idea that "if you do what you love you'll never
                work a day in your life"
                <ul>
                    <li> The funny part is that I really like my job, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better group of
                        coworkers/manager. And I don‚Äôt hate the actual work either. I just feel that that there‚Äôs always
                        other things I‚Äôd rather be doing.
                    </li>
                    <li> Work as a source of identity both makes sense and is kinda sad
                        <ul>
                            <li> Objectively most people spend more time working than they do doing anything else so I
                                get it
                            </li>
                            <li> On the other hand unless you're in some position where you‚Äôre totally doing what you
                                want to do and have complete autonomy (and would be doing identical work even if you
                                were at another company or on your own), a job kinda is just a job.
                            </li>
                            <li> Maybe I‚Äôm just holding on to some weird baseless fantasy that there‚Äôs something cool
                                and fun and <i>creative</i> I could be doing with my time instead
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learning is kind of overrated, or at the very least, treated too nebulously
                <ul>
                    <li> A lot of people cite the idea that "as long as you're learning something‚Äù things are good or
                        something
                    </li>
                    <li> Who cares if you're learning about something you're not interested in/things that are not
                        really transferrable
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Crazy that employers can credibly expect you to care about the mission of goals of a company the amount
                people who have orders of magnitude more to gain than you do
                <ul>
                    <li> Kind of disgusting and exploitative, should never believe these appeals
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Class consciousness in the workplace is mostly lacking  -- selling the mission to people who have nothing to
                gain from the success of the company somehow works
            </li>
            <li>The idea of getting a big fancy job that requires a lot of hours and a lot of caring and also pays well
                doesn‚Äôt really meet my goals of being able to not work.
                <ul>
                    <li> The type of people who succeed after starting companies or whatnot keep working after they‚Äôre
                        rich, which seems like it defeats the point of being rich (total freedom) to me.
                        <ul>
                            <li> maybe this is just the people who post about it
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Seems like a lot of my friends have the same kind of existential dread where they don‚Äôt know what they
                wanna do/feel like they are wasting their time and their potential. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                <ul>
                    <li> Working at a unicorn/FAANG isn‚Äôt enough to make people feel fulfilled, unsurprising
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Went a lot of places this year, took a lot of PTO. Don't know why I even bothered including this, but eh
                why not.
                <ul>
                    <li> Iceland
                        <ul>
                            <li> Really pretty if you‚Äôre into that type of thing (I‚Äôm definitively not)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Japan
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Very similar to each other.
                            </li>
                            <li> Food was eh
                            </li>
                            <li> Bars are excellent
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
            <li> Peru
                <ul>
                    <li> Beautiful place, Lima is a modern day city, and Cusco really is nice. Can get really fucking
                        cold.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Texas!
                <ul>
                    <li> This was somehow the trip I came away most excited from. Dallas Fort Worth Airport is one of
                        the most amazing places I‚Äôve ever been.
                    </li>
                    <li> Everything really is bigger
                    </li>
                    <li> The Alamo is dope.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Chicago
                <ul>
                    <li> Really really nice in the summer
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> India
                <ul>
                    <li> Developing like crazy
                    </li>
                    <li> Really polarized, Mumbai is a different world from Jaipur and other places my family is from
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> UAE
                <ul>
                    <li> Dubai is one big shopping mall
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> San Diego
                <ul>
                    <li> The only place in the states besides NYC and perhaps Berkeley I could see myself staying for a
                        while.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
            <li>>Week long trips are exhausting.
            </li>
            <li>There is a definite difference between vacation and travel and I need to do more vacation in 2020.
            </li>
            <li>Hoping to move abroad for a few years between 2020 and 2025. Doubt I would settle anywhere else (I‚Äôm way
                too culturally American to ever be anything more than an expat), but I think it‚Äôd introduce some novelty
                into my life
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Goals/Future Planning </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard to set tangible goals now -- timescale is long
            </li>
            <li>Have a lot of goals for this upcoming year nonetheless
                <ul>
                    <li> Consume less ephemeral content (podcasts, articles, etc)
                    </li>
                    <li> Consume more freestanding content (books, movies)
                    </li>
                    <li> Write more shit, maybe even eventually in paragraphs
                    </li>
                    <li> Bring back my dumb power rankings
                        <ul>
                            <li> really stupid but a lot of fun and a nice little fun project to sink my teeth into
                            </li>
                            <li> Also helps me maintain relationships with the few people whom I like enough that I
                                wouldn‚Äôt mind talking to them about the optimal thermometer temperature for 45 minutes.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Drink more beer
                    </li>
                    <li> Spend less time in bed
                        <ul>
                            <li> Spend probably ~12 hours in bed per day, gotta stop that
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Play more tennis or maybe pick up squash
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Health/Wellbeing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Definitely the weirdest year yet insofar as mental health goes
                <ul>
                    <li> Had some mood swings first half of the year, and a couple months of borderline manic anxiety
                    </li>
                    <li> mostly standard anxiety second half, mood stabilized a lot more
                    </li>
                    <li> Felt really good recently!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Debated seeing a therapist a bunch this year to clear the air (I, and a number of people I trust believe
                everyone should see one) but alas I am too cheap to pay for it
            </li>
            <li>Slept probably >8 hours a day and was still perpetually tired, but very happy to be sleeping/waking up
                without an alarm.
                <ul>
                    <li> Slept really late (between 2 and 3 every day), but this is the only reasonable way to get 2-3
                        continuous, uninterrupted hours to myself per day, so will probably continue.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Started playing tennis again! Really really happy about this.
            </li>
            <li>Did way less things I wasn't excited about, which I'm really hype about.
            </li>
            <li>Relationship with alcohol became way less adversarial in 2019
                <ul>
                    <li> Enjoy good beer now and look forward to drinking it
                    </li>
                    <li> Drink less than before and am intoxicated very infrequently, but enjoy it more than ever
                    </li>
                    <li> *Stomach feels like shit all the time
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Misc </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kinda burying the most important attitude thing in my year but the biggest thing has been that almost
                all bad things that happen to you are funny with time, and if you think about it with that lens, bad
                things are actually kinda good.
                <ul>
                    <li> Examples include: small injuries, almost all inconveniences (the more inconvenient the
                        funnier), small relationship problems, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li> Ex: ‚Äúgot this cool 4 hour layover how sick is that"
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li> Meeting new people is awful and extremely difficult
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Guess I have to get better at this in 2020, not sure how.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Important for me to have real close friends in your life, and I‚Äôm glad I made some new ones in 2019
            </li>
            <li>In the same vein, over time you sort of have to prune your peripheral frienships and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve got
                some friends who, regardless of distance, I‚Äôm able to stay in frequent contact with
            </li>
            <li>Found myself enjoying spending more time alone than ever
            </li>
            <li>Used to feel anxious about traditional life trajectory deadlines ‚Äúmarried by 30, kids by 32, move to
                suburbs, etc‚Äù but now realized I actually don‚Äôt want any of that shit and have no problem telling people
                to stay the fuck out of my business in that regard
            </li>
            <li>Novelty is the thing that keeps things interesting, gets harder to come across as you get older
                <ul>
                    <li> Mostly requires making unconventional decisions
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
